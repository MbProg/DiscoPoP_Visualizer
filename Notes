Functions: readable name plz
Dependency graph: in another tab? In same graph (too many edges)? When node is clicked?
Should loops display its function calls without being expanded?
How are function names mapped? (_Z3fooii, ii stants for two int parameters, what about double, complex etc...?,
could parse the name with that info)
Why are globalVariableNames == localVariableNames in functions? What are these for in non-function CUs?
Is read/writeDataSize in Bytes? I want to change it to kB/mB/gB...etc in display (readability)

Assumptions:


Problem:



TO-DO:  Hover: display node info
        Click on code line: show CU in graph (all code has CU right?)
        Use shapes to identify types of nodes and color for data (problem: too much red?, which colors? red,yellow,green? What are the levels?)
