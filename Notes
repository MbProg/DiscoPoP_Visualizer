Functions: readable name plz
Mark a root node somehow
Initial graph, how much to render? Just root node and have user expand everything on his own? (Options: expand all sub-nodes for a cluster)
Somehow put filemapping and CU-Nodes together?
Dependency graph: in another tab? In same graph (too many edges)? When node is clicked?
Add predecessor-CUs property to CUs
Add successor and predecessor nodes

Assumptions:  A node can have only one parentNode
              A non-CU node can have only CU-nodes as children


Problem:  Why is return stmt (1:30) a child of loop 1:19, but loop declaration (1:20) is not?
          Why does root node have faulty type (what should it be?)
          Objects missing IDs in mergesort...



TO-DO:    Hover: display node info
